    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Chat Anonymous Private. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and secure your data, including details about our encryption methods and group message accessibility.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use our chat service, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymous usage data to improve our services.</li>
      <li>Chat messages and communications.</li>
      <li>Group affiliation details to manage group functionalities.</li>
<!--       <li>Technical data such as IP addresses, browser types, and device information.</li> -->
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Encryption and Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your security is our priority. We employ state-of-the-art encryption protocols to secure all data transmissions between your device and our servers. This ensures that your messages are encrypted while in transit, protecting them from interception.</p>

    <h2>3. Group Message Visibility</h2>
    <p>Our platform is designed for group interactions. As a result, messages sent within a group are accessible to all members of that group. While encryption protects the data during transmission, once messages are stored on our servers, they can be viewed by all group participants. For one-on-one conversations, please use our direct messaging feature, which offers end-to-end encryption for enhanced privacy.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and maintain our service.</li>
      <li>Enhance and personalize user experience.</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze usage trends to improve our platform.</li>
      <li>Ensure the security and integrity of our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your information to third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your chat data is retained for as long as necessary to provide our services and as required by applicable laws. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data during this period.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page along with the revised effective date. We encourage you to review this policy regularly.</p>
